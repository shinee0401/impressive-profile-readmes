### To Add, Remove, or Update Github Profile Readmes: üìä

We welcome impressive Github profile readmes.

1. Fork this repository.

2. Clone your new repository to your system.

3. Add, remove, or update the profile.

   - To add a profile, add it below the heading of the category that best fits it, alphabetically and following this format: `- [username](link to your GitHub profile)`.

     Example: Adding profile of Aveek-Saha

     ```diff
       ### Minimalistic

       - [caneco](https://github.com/caneco)
       - [dennishartrampf](https://github.com/dennishartrampf)
     ```

   - To remove a profile, delete the exact line that contains the username and link of that profile.

     Example: Removing profile of Aveek-Saha

     ```diff
       ### Minimalistic

       - [alexmartinfr](https://github.com/alexmartinfr)

       - [caneco](https://github.com/caneco)
       - [dennishartrampf](https://github.com/dennishartrampf)
     ```

   - To update the category of a profile, simply move the specific line that includes the username and link of the profile from under the previous category heading to below the appropriate, newly chosen category heading. Additionally, to update the screenshot, remove or delete the `[<username>].webp` file from the `screenshot/` folder/directory. Finally, if you need to update the profile username or link, replace the current information with the updated username and link, making sure to maintain the alphabetical order and format.

   Example: Updating profile of Aveek-Saha

   ```diff
